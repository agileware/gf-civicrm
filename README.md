# Gravity Forms CiviCRM Integration

This is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) plugin that integrates the [Gravity Forms plugin](https://www.gravityforms.com/) with [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) using the [Form Processor extension](https://civicrm.org/extensions/form-processor).

Provides the following features:
* Extends Gravity Forms to get option lists and defaults from linked CiviCRM Form Processors
* Will detect if the submitting user is logged in and if so, use their CiviCRM API Key for the form submission

# Requirements

Integration with the CiviCRM Form Processor uses Web Hooks, which requires the [Gravity Forms, Webhooks Add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/webhooks/). This add-on is currently bundled with the [Gravity Forms, Elite License](https://www.gravityforms.com/elite-license-plan/)
